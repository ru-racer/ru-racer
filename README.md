# ru-racer

The goal to build **RURacer-2** was to improve platform performance, such as more accurate wheel encoders and more advanced embedded processors. Compared to RURacer-1, the new platform achieves **four times lower latency (less than 7 ms)** and **twenty times faster computation**. To accomplish this, a custom hardware architecture was designed, including wheel encoder fittings for individual wheel speed monitoring, flexible interfaces, and an upgraded IMU system capable of estimating vehicle orientation in three dimensions.

This platform enables researchers to utilize modern hardware/software stacks, including **ROS** and **NVIDIA Jetson TX2**, for advanced real-time robotic control.

## Hardware and Software Architecture

The vehicle platform is based on a 1/7th scale **Traxxas XO-1**, which supports aggressive driving modes like drifting due to its optional rear-wheel drive configuration and high-speed capability (up to 100 MPH). 

To monitor wheel speeds, **EM1 optical encoders** from US Digital were custom-fit to each wheel. The control stack is powered by **NVIDIA Jetson TX2**, chosen for its real-time computational capabilities. TX2 runs **Ubuntu L4T** with onboard WiFi configured for communication between the host machine and the vehicle.

### Key Features

- **ROS-based communication framework**
- **High-speed UART connection (100 Hz)** between TX2 and a microcontroller using `rosserial`
- **Real-time NMPC motion controller** on TX2
- **Adafruit BNO055 IMU** providing 9 DOF sensing
- **FLIR Blackfly GigE camera** (3.2 MP, 30 FPS) used for localization with 2.6 mm accuracy

This architecture supports tight integration between high-frequency sensor acquisition, low-level control, and edge computation for real-time planning and perception tasks.

## How to Use

This repository includes MATLAB comparison scripts for analyzing different driving strategies in stunt-level vehicle maneuvers.

### Clone this repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/ru-racer/ru-racer.git
   cd ru-racer

### Open any of the **speed_compare_*.m** files in MATLAB:
For example:
- **`speed_compare_5ms14rad.m`**:  
This file simulates a U-turn maneuver at **5 m/s** speed and **1.4 m** turning radius.

### Running the File
Running the script will:

- Execute **three methods**:
  - A **Stanford-developed method** with handling limitations
  - A **baseline method** with no handling constraints
  - **Our proposed Safe Stunt Maneuvering method**, designed to safely perform aggressive maneuvers
- Save the results in **matrix format**
- Generate **comparison plots automatically**

You can modify the **speed** and **radius** by editing the filename and the script parameters accordingly.
